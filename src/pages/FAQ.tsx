                  <AccordionTrigger>How does image compression work?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    Our advanced compression algorithms analyze your images and reduce file size while maintaining visual quality. 
                    We use smart techniques like removing metadata, optimizing color palettes, and applying efficient encoding 
                    to achieve the best compression ratios without noticeable quality loss.

                  <AccordionTrigger>Is my data safe and private?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    Absolutely! All image processing happens directly in your browser using client-side technology. 
                    Your images never leave your device and are not uploaded to our servers. This ensures complete 
                    privacy and security of your files.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    We support the most popular image formats including JPEG, PNG, and WebP. Our system automatically 
                    detects the format and applies the most appropriate compression settings for optimal results.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    Yes! Our batch processing feature allows you to compress multiple images simultaneously. 
                    Free users can process up to 5 images at once, while Premium subscribers can handle up to 50 images 
                    in a single batch with advanced queue management.

                  <AccordionTrigger>How much can I reduce file sizes?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    Compression results vary depending on the original image, but typically you can expect 60-80% file size 
                    reduction while maintaining excellent visual quality. Our side-by-side comparison tool lets you preview 
                    the results before downloading.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    Since all processing happens in your browser, compressed images are stored temporarily in your device's 
                    memory until you download them. Once you close the browser tab or navigate away, all image data is 
                    automatically cleared for your privacy and security.
